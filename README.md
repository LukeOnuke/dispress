# Dispress
The nice looking discord rpc mod for fabric folks.

Adds discord rich presence (rpc) to minecraft. Includes status for multiplayer, single-player and even when looking at menus. Some servers, like hypixel, hidysmp, and some others have their server icon show up in rich presence. If you want to suggest a server icon to be added to the database, post an issue using the server-application example.

# Setup

1. Download the desired one from github releases, or curseforge (github gets more releases).
2. Download fabric api with version newer than ***0.37.0+1.17***
3. Put it all in the mods folder (`%appdata%/.minecraft/mods` or if you are using a custom minecraft dir `<your-instalation-path>/mods`)
4. Start the game. If you have done it correctly discord presence will be on.

**Requires fabric api >0.37.0+1.17**
